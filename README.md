# Blastoid_scRNAseq_Comparison

This repository documents the scripts used to evaluate scRNAseq data from blastoid models. 
The analysis was conducted using the following steps:
1. Generating count matrices from fastq files.
2. Preprocess count matrices to generate QCed data.
3. Annotate cell types using a consensus scheme.
4. Integrate datasets.
5. Analyze data:
   - Cluster distribution analysis.
   - Lineage module score analysis.
The results lead to the sequencing and analysis of founding cell lines.
7. Founding cell line analysis.
   
The scripts are used in a submission currently under revision.
